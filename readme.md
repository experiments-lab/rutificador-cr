Typing strong code with TypeScript
=================================

This is a little modification of the original chilean rutificador from @mrpatiwi, see the [original rutificador](https://github.com/mrpatiwi/rutificador) and [the web chilean RUT](https://chile.rutificador.com/)
.

The original is written in ECMA2015, I wanted to put in practice my recent learning in TS, so I translated everything to simple-strong typed-typescript code.

Just run:

 ```bssh
 npm install
 npm start
 ```
 
 By the way, this one supports not only the chilean RUT, you can search also for people from:
 
  - Argentina
  - Costa Rica
  - Honduras
  - Paraguay
  - Peru

You can find more info in howto.ts

That is all. Happy Hacking :octocat:

#### **PD**: index.ts is the core class, interfaces.ts are models and howto.ts is a demo.
